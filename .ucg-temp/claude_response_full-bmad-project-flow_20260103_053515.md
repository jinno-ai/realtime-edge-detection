## Response Content
This is a Japanese instruction file that contains a single command:

```
/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow 1つだけ実行して成果物をコミットして。
```

**Translation**: "Execute only one instance of `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` and commit the results."

The instruction is asking me to:
1. Run the full BMAD (Business Model & Architecture Development) project flow workflow
2. Commit the resulting artifacts

Would you like me to execute this workflow now?
