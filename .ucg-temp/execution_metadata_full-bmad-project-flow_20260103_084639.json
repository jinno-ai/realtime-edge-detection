The instruction was to execute the full BMAD project flow workflow once and commit the results.\n\nBased on the git status, I can see:\n- The workflow has already been completed (recent commits show \"feat: complete Full BMAD Project Flow execution\")\n- There are temporary files from that execution still in `.ucg-temp/`\n- The `.ucg_hang_detection.json` file has been modified\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Clean up the temporary files** from the previous workflow execution?\n2. **Review the execution results** that were produced?\n3. **Run the workflow again** if you need to regenerate the artifacts?\n4. **Something else** related to this project?\n\nPlease let me know what you'd like me to do with these files or the project.\n",
