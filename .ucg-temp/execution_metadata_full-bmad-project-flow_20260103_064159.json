Now let me check if there are any other documents to include before proceeding.\n\n**Welcome Jinno to comprehensive epic and story creation!**\n\n## [Step 2/13] 実行中: create-epics-and-stories\n\n**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE VALIDATION:**\n\nI've successfully found and validated all required documents:\n\n✅ **PRD Document**: `/home/jinno/jinno-ai-portfolio-kit/realtime-edge-detection/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/02-PRD.md`\n✅ **Architecture Document**: `/home/jinno/jinno-ai-portfolio-kit/realtime-edge-detection/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`\n❌ **UX Design Document**: Not found (as expected - this is a backend/CLI toolkit)\n\nBefore proceeding, are there any other documents you'd like me to include for analysis, or anything found that should be excluded?\n\nNow I'll extract all requirements from these documents.\n\n### Extracted Functional Requirements:\n\n**Found 10 major Functional Requirement groups (FR-1 through FR-10) with detailed sub-requirements:**\n\n**FR-1: Configuration Management (P0)**\n- FR-1.1: YAML configuration files\n- FR-1.2: Environment variable overrides\n- FR-1.3: Config validation with clear error messages\n- FR-1.4: Profile-based configs (dev, prod, testing)\n\n**FR-2: Model Management (P0)**\n- FR-2.1: Abstract model interface for multiple detectors\n- FR-2.2: Support YOLO v8, YOLO v10, and custom models\n- FR-2.3: Automatic model download and caching\n- FR-2.4: Model versioning and compatibility checks\n\n**FR-3: Hardware Optimization (P0)**\n- FR-3.1: Automatic device detection (CPU/GPU/TPU)\n- FR-3.2: Explicit device selection via CLI/config\n- FR-3.3: Quantization support (INT8/FP16)\n- FR-3.4: ONNX export and optimization\n\n**FR-4: Observability (P0)**\n- FR-4.1: Structured logging (JSON format support)\n- FR-4.2: Performance metrics (latency, FPS, memory)\n- FR-4.3: Export metrics to Prometheus/Grafana\n- FR-4.4: Request/response logging with timestamps\n\n**FR-5: Error Handling (P0)**\n- FR-5.1: Graceful degradation on device errors\n- FR-5.2: Retry logic for transient failures\n- FR-5.3: Clear error messages with resolution hints\n- FR-5.4: Comprehensive exception handling\n\n**FR-6: CLI Enhancements (P1)**\n- FR-6.1 through FR-6.4: Interactive mode, batch processing, progress bars, output format selection\n\n**FR-7: API Improvements (P1)**\n- FR-7.1 through FR-7.4: Async detection, batch API, streaming detection, callback/hook system\n\n**FR-8: Testing & Validation (P1)**\n- FR-8.1 through FR-8.4: Integration tests, performance regression tests, accuracy validation, hardware test matrix\n\n**FR-9: Documentation (P1)**\n- FR-9.1 through FR-9.4: API reference, deployment guides, performance tuning guide, troubleshooting guide\n\n**FR-10: Containerization (P2)**\n- FR-10.1 through FR-10.4: Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, Helm charts\n\n### Extracted Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n**Found 17 NFRs across 5 categories:**\n\n**Performance (NFR-P1 through NFR-P4)**:\n- NFR-P1: Max 30ms inference latency on CPU (640x640)\n- NFR-P2: Max 10ms inference latency on GPU/TPU\n- NFR-P3: Support 30+ FPS real-time processing\n- NFR-P4: Memory footprint < 500MB (excluding model)\n\n**Reliability (NFR-R1 through NFR-R4)**\n**Scalability (NFR-S1 through NFR-S3)**\n**Maintainability (NFR-M1 through NFR-M4)**\n**Usability (NFR-U1 through NFR-U4)**\n\n### Additional Requirements from Architecture:\n\n**Infrastructure & Technical Requirements:**\n- Plugin architecture with abstract base classes (AbstractDetector)\n- Dependency injection for testability\n- Async/await for I/O operations\n- Structured logging with context\n- DeviceManager for hardware abstraction (CPU, CUDA, MPS, TFLite, ONNX)\n- Configuration system with YAML support\n- Error handling framework with error codes and recovery hints\n- Model optimization pipeline (ONNX export, quantization INT8/FP16)\n- Lazy loading and model caching\n- Batch processing support\n- Containerization with Docker\n- Security: model validation, input validation, dependency pinning\n- Migration strategy: 3-phase gradual migration\n\nDo these extracted requirements accurately represent what needs to be built? Any additions or corrections?\n\n**Confirm the Requirements are complete and correct to [C] continue:**\n",
