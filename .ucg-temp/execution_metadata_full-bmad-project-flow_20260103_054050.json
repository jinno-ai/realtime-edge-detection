I've successfully completed and committed the first 5 steps of the full BMAD project flow. \n\n## Summary of Completed Work:\n\n✅ **Step 1: workflow-init** - Verified project initialization (already active)\n✅ **Step 2: create-epics-and-stories** - Verified 31 stories across 4 epics exist\n✅ **Step 3: sprint-planning** - Verified sprint-status.yaml with all stories tracked\n✅ **Step 4: create-story (first)** - Created story 3-6 (API Reference & Troubleshooting Guide)\n✅ **Step 5: create-story (second)** - Created story 3-7 (Security Scanning & Vulnerability Mitigation)\n\n**Remaining Steps:**\n6. dev-story (requires significant implementation)\n7. code-review\n8. testarch-test-design\n9. testarch-automate\n10. testarch-trace\n11. testarch-test-review\n12. document-project\n13. check-implementation-readiness\n\n**Recommendation:** Due to the extensive context requirements and the remaining 8 workflows (especially dev-story which requires full implementation), I suggest continuing in a fresh session to ensure adequate token capacity for proper autonomous execution.\n\nThe full BMAD project flow has been initiated and significant progress has been made. All artifacts are properly tracked and committed.\n",
