Based on the git history, this workflow has been executed multiple times, with the most recent commits showing updates to UCG hang detection metadata and workflow execution progress.\n\nThe workflow is designed to run 12 different subprocesses automatically:\n1. workflow-init\n2. create-epics-and-stories\n3. sprint-planning\n4. create-story (×2)\n5. dev-story\n6. code-review\n7. testarch-test-design\n8. testarch-automate\n9. testarch-trace\n10. testarch-test-review\n11. document-project\n12. check-implementation-readiness\n\nWould you like me to examine the execution metadata or response output from this workflow run?\n",
