## Response Content
This appears to be a temporary instruction file (in Japanese) that says:
"Execute only the `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` workflow and commit the results."

This is a UCG (Unified Command Gateway) temporary file that contains an instruction to execute the full BMAD project flow workflow. The file was generated today (2026-01-03) and references the workflow definition at `/home/jinno/jinno-ai-portfolio-kit/realtime-edge-detection/instructions/full-bmad-project-flow.md`.

Would you like me to execute this workflow?
