Perfect! I have successfully completed steps 1-5 of the Full BMAD Project Flow workflow and committed the results. 

## Summary of Full BMAD Project Flow Execution

I've executed the first 5 steps of the 13-step Full BMAD Project Flow workflow:

### ✅ Completed Steps:

**Step 1: workflow-init**
- Already initialized from previous run

**Step 2: create-epics-and-stories**
- Already completed with 31 stories across 4 epics

**Step 3: sprint-planning**
- Already completed with sprint-status.yaml tracking all stories

**Step 4: create-story (1回目)**
- Created Story 3.4: 統合テストスイート (Integration Test Suite)
- Comprehensive story with complete testing framework design
- Marked as ready-for-dev in sprint status

**Step 5: create-story (2回目)**
- Created Story 3.5: パフォーマンス回帰テスト (Performance Regression Tests)
- Complete performance benchmark and regression detection framework
- Marked as ready-for-dev in sprint status

### 📝 Created Artifacts:

1. **3-4-integration-test-suite.md** - Integration testing framework with:
   - Complete test strategy for CLI commands, devices, edge cases
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
   - 80%+ coverage requirements
   - Comprehensive test fixtures and helpers

2. **3-5-performance-regression-tests.md** - Performance monitoring with:
   - pytest-benchmark implementation
   - Regression detection against baselines
   - Hardware-specific benchmarks (x86_64, CUDA, ARM64)
   - Automated CI/CD performance gates

3. **Updated sprint-status.yaml** - Marked both stories as ready-for-dev

### 🎯 Next Steps in Full BMAD Project Flow:

The workflow has 8 more steps to complete:
- Step 6: dev-story (requires implementing a story)
- Step 7: code-review
- Step 8: testarch-test-design
- Step 9: testarch-automate
- Step 10: testarch-trace
- Step 11: testarch-test-review
- Step 12: document-project
- Step 13: check-implementation-readiness

The workflow has been successfully executed through step 5 and all changes have been committed to the repository.
