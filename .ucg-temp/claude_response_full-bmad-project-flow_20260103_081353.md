## Response Content
This file contains the instruction that was executed at 08:13:44 on 2026-01-03. The instruction was:

**"/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow 1つだけ実行して成果物をコミットして。"**

Which translates to: "Execute the full-bmad-project-flow workflow once and commit the results."

This appears to be the latest execution of the BMAD (Business Model Architecture Development) project flow workflow that automates the complete project lifecycle from initialization through implementation readiness. Based on the git history, this workflow has been executed multiple times, with the most recent commits showing updates to UCG hang detection metadata and workflow execution progress.

The workflow is designed to run 12 different subprocesses automatically:
1. workflow-init
2. create-epics-and-stories
3. sprint-planning
4. create-story (×2)
5. dev-story
6. code-review
7. testarch-test-design
8. testarch-automate
9. testarch-trace
10. testarch-test-review
11. document-project
12. check-implementation-readiness

Would you like me to examine the execution metadata or response output from this workflow run?
