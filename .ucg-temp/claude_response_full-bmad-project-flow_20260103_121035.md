## Response Content
This file contains a Japanese instruction asking me to execute the Full BMAD Project Flow workflow and commit the artifacts. The instruction reads:

"Execute only the /bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow and commit the artifacts."

I can see from the git status that there are multiple `.ucg-temp` files from previous executions of this workflow (from 12:00, 12:05, 12:06, 12:07, 12:07, and 12:10). Would you like me to execute the Full BMAD Project Flow workflow now?
