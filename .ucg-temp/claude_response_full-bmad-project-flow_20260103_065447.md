## Response Content
This is a UCG (Unified Code Graph) temporary file containing an instruction in Japanese that translates to:

**"Execute /bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow just once and commit the results."**

This appears to be part of a BMAD (Business Model Architecture Development) project workflow. The file was generated on 2026-01-03 at 06:54:38 and references the source instruction file at `/home/jinno/jinno-ai-portfolio-kit/realtime-edge-detection/instructions/full-bmad-project-flow.md`.

Would you like me to:
1. Execute the full BMAD project flow workflow?
2. Read the source instruction file?
3. Check what other temporary files exist from previous workflow executions?
