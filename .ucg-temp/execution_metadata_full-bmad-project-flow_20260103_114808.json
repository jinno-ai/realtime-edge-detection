The file was generated from `instructions/full-bmad-project-flow.md` and appears to be part of an automated workflow execution system (UCG - Unified Command Gateway).\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Check what the execution metadata contains to see what was actually done?\n2. Review the execution artifacts that were generated?\n3. Examine the git status to understand what changes were made?\n\nOr did you have a specific question about this workflow execution?\n",
