However, I notice from the git status that there have been several recent executions of this workflow already (based on the timestamps in the `.ucg-temp` directory).\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Execute this workflow again (it appears to have been run multiple times recently)?\n2. Clean up these temporary UCG files?\n3. Something else?\n",
