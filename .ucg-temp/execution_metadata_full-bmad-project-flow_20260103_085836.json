The instruction is in Japanese and says:\n\n\"Execute just one `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` and commit the artifacts.\"\n\nThis appears to be from a previous workflow execution. Would you like me to:\n\n1. **Execute the full BMAD project flow workflow** - This runs the complete 12-step BMAD lifecycle from initialization to implementation readiness\n2. **Clean up these temporary files** - Remove the `.ucg-temp` directory and its contents\n3. **Review what was produced** - Check the artifacts from previous executions\n\nWhat would you like me to do?\n",
