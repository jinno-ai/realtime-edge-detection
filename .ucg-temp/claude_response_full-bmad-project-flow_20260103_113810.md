### 次のステップ:

プロジェクトが実装準備完了状態になりました。引き続き実装を進めることができます。

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Continue implementation with Story 1.4 (device-detection-selection)
2. Follow sprint cadence with TDD approach
3. Run code reviews after each story completion
4. Expand test automation coverage
5. Maintain quality gates with traceability validation

**Full BMAD Project Flow execution completed successfully!** 🎉

The project is now ready for systematic implementation with comprehensive planning, testing strategy, and quality controls in place.
