## Response Content
This file contains a single instruction in Japanese requesting to execute the full BMAD project flow workflow once and then commit the results.

The instruction translates to: "Execute `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` once and commit the artifacts."

Would you like me to execute this workflow?
