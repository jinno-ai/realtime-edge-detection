## Response Content
This is a UCG (Unified Command Gateway) temporary instruction file that was generated when running the full-bmad-project-flow workflow. It contains a Japanese instruction:

**Translation:** "Execute only `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` and commit the artifacts."

This instruction file was created at 08:46:39 on 2026-01-03 as part of the workflow execution process. The workflow appears to have already been executed based on your git history showing the recent commit "feat: complete Full BMAD Project Flow execution".

Would you like me to:
1. Check the current status of the workflow execution?
2. Review the artifacts that were generated?
3. Something else?
