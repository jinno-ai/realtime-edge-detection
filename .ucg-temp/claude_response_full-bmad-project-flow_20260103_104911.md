## Response Content
I can see this is a temporary instruction file from the Unified Code Generation (UCG) system, generated on January 3, 2026. The instruction is in Japanese and translates to:

"Execute only one `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` and commit the artifacts."

This appears to be an automated instruction for running the Full BMAD Project Flow workflow and committing the results. The file is part of the UCG temporary files generated during workflow execution in your realtime-edge-detection project.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this file or the workflow it references?
