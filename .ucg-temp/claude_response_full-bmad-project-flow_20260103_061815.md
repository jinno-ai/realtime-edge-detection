## Response Content
This file contains a simple instruction in Japanese asking to execute the `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` workflow and commit the results.

The instruction translates to: "Just execute the full-bmad-project-flow workflow once and commit the results."

Would you like me to execute this workflow? This appears to be a comprehensive BMAD project flow that runs through all 12 steps from project initialization to implementation readiness automatically.
