## Response Content
This file contains a Japanese instruction asking to execute the `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` workflow once and commit the results.

The file appears to be a temporary instruction file for a BMAD (Business Model AI Development) workflow execution, generated at 2026-01-03T12:17:44. It's part of the `.ucg-temp` directory which contains execution artifacts from previous workflow runs.

Would you like me to:
1. Execute this workflow as instructed?
2. Analyze the workflow artifacts already generated?
3. Something else?
