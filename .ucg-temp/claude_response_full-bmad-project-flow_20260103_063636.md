## Response Content
This file contains a simple instruction in Japanese requesting to run only one instance of the `/bmad:bmm:workflows:full-bmad-project-flow` workflow and then commit the results.

The instruction says: "Execute the full-bmad-project-flow just once and commit the results."

Would you like me to execute this workflow and commit the results when complete?
