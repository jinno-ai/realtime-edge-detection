Would you like me to:\n\n1. Execute this workflow now?\n2. Explain what this workflow does first?\n3. Something else?\n\nThe `full-bmad-project-flow` workflow appears to be a comprehensive automation that runs all 12+ BMAD workflows sequentially from project initialization through implementation readiness.\n",
